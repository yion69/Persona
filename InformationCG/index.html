                                            ENTJs are planners. Making decisions and having a schedule or course of action planned out gives them a sense of predictability and control.They are highly rational, good at spotting problems, and excel at taking charge. These tendencies make them natural leaders who are focused on efficiently solving problems.

They also tend to be too hard on themselves, blaming themselves for when things go wrong and not giving themselves enough credit when things go right.

This is most usually the result of a defensive rather than an aggressive approach.Turbulent executives are under more pressure to conform. This stress might cause these people to become more sensitive to the needs of others.Turbulent ESTJs also require the company of others. However, they have a more difficult time understanding friendship than ESTJ-As do. The reason for this is because they are more sensitive to the needs of others, which makes them fearful of disappointing their friends.

                                    <b>ESTP-T:</b> The ESTP-T personality type is a true entrepreneur. They are natural risk-takers and enjoy the thrill of exploring new ideas, but they’re also practical enough to know that not every idea will work out. If an idea does fail, it’s because they tried their best and learned from the experience. Some people might call them stubborn or insensitive – but in truth, these qualities make them great entrepreneurs who can get things done without worrying about social niceties or small details.

                                    <b>ESTP-A :</b> The ESTP-A is most likely to be assertive, innovative, spontaneous, quick thinking, and generally goal-oriented. They know how to get what they want in life by utilizing the tools at hand or finding new ones that work better for them. They are usually highly competitive and need to “win.” When it comes to impulsive behaviors, the ESTP-A will do anything for excitement.

                                            Make decisions quickly: When confronted by problems, people with this personality type quickly look at the facts and devise an immediate solution. They tend to improvise rather than spend a great deal of time planning.

                                            Prefer the practical over the abstract: ESTPs don't have a lot of use for abstract theories or concepts. They are more practical, preferring straightforward information that they can think about rationally and act upon immediately.

                                            Have strong social skills: They are very observant, often picking up on details that other people never notice. Other people sometimes describe them as "fast-talkers" who are highly persuasive. In social settings, they often seem like they are a few steps ahead of the conversation.

                                            Act impulsively at times: ESTPs are not planners. They react in the moment and can often be quite impulsive or even risk-taking. This 'leap before they look' attitude can be problematic at times and it may lead them to say or do things they regret.

                                    <b>ESFP-A:</b> Personality types are assertive entertainers who live in the moment. They enjoy being spontaneous and often take risks. ESFPs have a desire to be around people, making them fun and friendly companions. They love to connect with others through their senses and creativity. However, the ESFP-A can stumble if they don’t know what they want. The ESFP-A personality type thrives on variety and so will not be content with being stuck in the same routine for too long without any change, which may make them a little restless at times. They are often good problem solvers who excel during brainstorming sessions due to their ability to come up with many creative solutions quickly before anyone else has had time to think of one.

                                    <b>ESFP-T:</b> Turbulent entertainers (ESFP-T) are the life of the party and love to have fun. They’re spontaneous, energetic, and highly social. ESFPs like variety in their lives and want to experience as much as possible. This personality type is often called “spontaneous” or “dramatic.” It can also be described as dynamic, flexible, enthusiastic, expressive, outgoing, and gregarious. Turbulent Entertainers are drawn more strongly than other types to acting out for attention; they are also more prone than average to being irresponsible on occasion – not because they’re lazy but because they don’t understand what it means when things need doing now

                                            They are practical and resourceful. ESFPs prefer to learn through hands-on experience and tend to dislike book learning and theoretical discussions. Because of this, students with ESFP personality types sometimes struggle in traditional classroom settings. However, they excel in situations where they are allowed to interact with others or learn through direct experience.

                                            They figure things out as they go along. ESFPs live very much in the here-and-now and sometimes fail to think about how current actions will lead to long-term consequences. They will often rush into a new situation and figure things out as they happen. They also tend to dislike routine, enjoy new experiences, and are always looking for a new adventure.
